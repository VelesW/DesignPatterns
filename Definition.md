# What is design pattern ?
Design pattern is a sort of reusable code components. Every implementation can be slightly different but the idea behind soltion of some problem is the same.

## What is the difference between algorithm and design pattern ?
### Birthday party
### Algorithm analogy
Let's imagine that tomorrow I have a birthday, so my wife it's going to bake a cake for me. She'll be cooking a cake following instructions in recipe step by step. In this case the recipe is an algorithm, because provide instruction to produce the same thing for the same ingridients.

### Design Pattern analogy
So everybody have different imagination of birthday party but some elements are constant e.g like cake and thanks to them you can recognize birthday party as a birthday party.
Birthday party is an analogy to the design pattern which stands for reausable idea even if some aspects are slightly different in every case.

## How we divide design patterns ?
We can divide design patterns in three groups. Creational, Behavioral and Structural.

### Creational
This type of design pattern are responsible for creating objects
- Factory method
- Singleton 
- Builder 
- Prototype
- Abstract method

### Structural
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Decorator
- Composite
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral
- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
